# VISCAPTZfromStreamDeck

Project to control VISCA-protocol PTZ cameras through OBS via a Elgato Stream Deck

Goal is to have Stream Deck buttons correspond to camera view presets.  Pressing a button moves whichever camera isn't live in OBS to that preset location then switches to it in OBS.  Future option planned to force one camera to be used - if that camera is live it will move other camera to wide view and transition to it before moving requested camera.
